### Motors
#### Stepper vs. Servo
Â A stepper motor if your application meets any of the following criteria:

- Low speed and high accuracy
- Short, rapid repetitive movements
- High torque and low speed
- You prefer simple control

Steppers have the advantages of lower system costs, minimum system tuning, low maintenance, and rugged construction.

Go with a servo motor if your application meets any of these requirements:

- Control of the applied force
- Requirements for high speeds
- Dynamic motion profiles
