## General Description 

The final product is supposed to be a fully functional plotter ("drawing machine") with a very high level of precision so that it would be possible to imitate human-like handwriting. In the best scenario it should also be able to write in cursive and swap pens. Despite the fact that the main goal is to reach an ability for this machine to "write", an intermediate step of drawing basic shapes and the overall functionality of drawing something is also planned. 

The expected recults are:

## Software Idea 

Due to the fact that the hardware side of this project can already be regarded as a rather "challenging one",  the software ideas have been divided into a simpler version and a more difficult one: 

1. Easy version: the application (mobile/desktop) will be able to work in two modes: Text and Image. The Rext mode will let the user type some text with an option of choosing among a limited selection of fonts (even simpler: just print or cursive). The Image mode will recieve an image in some specific format (further research required) or convert general image formats into some specific one.

2. Complex idea: same features as in the easy version, but with the third mode called "Rewrite". The Rewrite mode is supposed to receive a camera input, work as an OCR scanner in order to recognize the text (either handwritten cursive or print style) and afterwards use the scanned text in the same way the Text mode works.
